eSports Bracket - WordPress Plugin
=======

Add 8/16/32 and 64 players/team brackets to your WordPress content by using a shortcode.

This project has been on hold for a while but we want to bring some new light on to it as eSports becomes more popular 
we want to enable users who run WordPress the ability to report on current tournments for their favourite eSport with
this nice addition of a tournament bracket.

Primarily focused on Starcraft II, we plan on adding more support for League of Legends and may even add Dota 2 support.
